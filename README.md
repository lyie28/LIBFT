# LIBFT_
Recoding a series of key useful functions in C to create my own library of functions

To download project:
Git clone [url of this project]

To create library: 'make' || To create bonus library: 'make bonus'

In the main where you use functions from the library, #include "includes/libft.h"

To compile your main with the library, you can do as follows: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -L. -lft -o your_executable_file_name_here
